## Academic Integrity Notice

### Important: Do Not Copy or Reuse This Code

As a student at Carnegie Mellon University, I am committed to upholding the principles of academic integrity. This repository is for personal reference and portfolio purposes only. 

If you are currently enrolled in 16-662 Robot Autonomy or a similar course:

- **Do not copy, reproduce, or submit any code from this repository as your own work.**
- **Do not use these solutions to circumvent the learning process of your coursework.**
- **Consult your course's collaboration policy before viewing this repository.**

Remember, the goal of your coursework is to learn and understand the material, not just to complete assignments. Using others' solutions undermines this goal and violates CMU's Academic Integrity Policy.

### Upholding Academic Integrity

- Produce your own original work for all assignments and projects.
- Collaborate only when explicitly permitted by your instructor.
- Properly cite any references or sources you use in your work.
- If unsure about what's allowed, always ask your instructor for clarification.

Violations of academic integrity can result in serious consequences, including course failure and disciplinary action.
